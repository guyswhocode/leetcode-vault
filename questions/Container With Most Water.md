/**
 * 11. Container With Most Water
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/
 * Difficulty: Medium
 *
 * Given n non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an ,` where each represents a point at
 * coordinate `(i, ai)`. `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of
 * the line `i` is at `(i, ai)` and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which, together with the
 * x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
 *
 * Notice that you may not slant the container.
